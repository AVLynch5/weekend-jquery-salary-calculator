# jQuery Salary Calculator

## Description

_Duration: 2 day sprint_

This application is a convenient tool that could help employers keep track of their employee information and total monthly salary costs. 

The program allows users to input the following employee information: 
* first name
* last name
* ID, title
* annual salary

Hitting the 'submit' button stores the provided information as an employee object in an array and displays it to the DOM in a table, along with the calculated total monthly cost of employee salaries. If that monthly total is $20,000 or less the field displays green, else it displays red.

Pressing a 'delete' button in the 'actions' column removes that employee from the displayed table and updates the total monthly cost of employee salaries.

## Installation

No installation required. Simply download or clone this repository and open index.html in your favorite browser (that supports javascript and html).

## Usage

1. Enter the required employee information into the specified input fields. All fields must be filled, and the annual salary value must be positive.
2. Enter the information using the 'submit' button. The information will display in the table and 'monthly cost' section.
3. Click a 'delete' button in the 'actions' column of the table to remove that employee from the table. The table and 'monthly cost' will update.
